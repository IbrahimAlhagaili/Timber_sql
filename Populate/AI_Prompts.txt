AI PROMPTS All Generated Using Chat GPT 3.5 (Some prompts leave out entering in information already generated by CHATGPT from previous prompts or already provided in an earlier context)

use this table strucutre here to help me generate oracle SQL insert statements in future prompts (Create table structure found in the Build folder script)

the first insert statement should be for 7 different customers with unique and meaningful data. 

Could you also make me some insert statements for 20 unique and meaningful products with 5 product reviews ?
only 5 of the 20 products need product reviews 
These should also have meaningful and unique names / descriptions
each product should be supplied by at least 1 supplier 

create me some insert statements for 10 categories with both categories and SubCategories deep which are related and fit the products described earlier 
these categories should be meaningful and also be able to be linked to products 

also create me some insert statements for 4 unique and meaningful suppliers that link to a product through the product supplier bridge
some of these products should be available from multiple suppliers 

Use the current insert strucutre (entered modified insert data provided by CHATGPT) and the info you have been providing for future prompts 

create me some insert statements for the locations, taxes, and shipping tables that have at least 3 different provinces and their corresponding rates 
make this data unique and also meaningful
there should be enough unique locations for each customer making an order
the only thing needed to be fixed is if customer id-1 makes an order with location id-1 it should be the same for order 2 and different customers should not use the same location id

I need an insert statement for 10 orders, these orders should be linked to the products through the bridge table and linked to a customer that already exists, some customers should have orders and some should not.
make sure to also link these orders to the products using the bridging table 
some of these orders should also be made by the same customer since i only have 7 customers and some customers should have no orders

finally generate me some insert statements for the payment of each order following the structure described earlier
no the tax_id and shipping_id should be associated with the location_id for each order which should be the same for the orders made by the same customers 
the tax_id and shipping_id should be the same as the location_id in the order table for each order based on this strucutre

Is this the correct delete order for my script (enter delete order for populate script)
(corrected order of delete script)
